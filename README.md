Gotcha-Find
===========

This project is the implementation of the UI part of my master thesis, Gotcha: Document Retireval System Using Visual Layout Manipulation. The purpose of my research is to allow users to search documents without the the need of typing keywords. The users can input a visual query based on document's visual layout, and the system will find the most closely matched document pages based on the difference of spatial relations and geometrical differences.
